# Codewars Katas Collection

A personal collection of solutions to coding challenges (katas) from [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/users/yosoyrev). This repository showcases my problem-solving skills and progress in various programming languages, focusing on algorithmic thinking, data structures, and optimization.

Each kata solution includes clear, commented code and explanations when needed. This repo is perfect for:

- Practicing coding interview questions
- Learning different approaches to common algorithmic problems
- Tracking my journey in competitive programming

Feel free to explore, learn, and contribute!
